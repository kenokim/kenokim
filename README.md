# Kunho Kim
- Backend Engineer (Java, Python, TypeScript)
- GenAI Application Engineer (Prompt Engineering, AI Agent)

I have experience in backend, GenAI stack, and cloud development (Azure, GCP) through work on security solutions and B2C SaaS products.

While majoring in Chemical Engineering, I was inspired by Andrew Ngâ€™s ML course and reinforcement learning, which led me to pursue a career as a developer.
I have extensive experience building applications with GenAI (Cursor, Vibe Coding) and have developed multiple AI Agent applications (both in professional work and personal projects).
